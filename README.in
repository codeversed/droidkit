libdroidkit
-----------

Included in this package you'll find the libdroidkit jar file, resources directory, assets directory and a script to help install the library into your application.

Steps for easy install
----------------------

1. Run the buildpkg command (might need to run chmod +x buildpkg first) with --install /path/to/android/project/root

2. Grab a refreshment for all the hard work you did in step 1.

What'll you end up with after running `buildpkg` is the library in the libs directory of your app and the resources merged into your existing
resources directory; same goes for the assets directory.
